# How to test Game for HW 2 submission:
open the project in Unity
inside the assets folder you will see the Prefab, Scripts and Scenes folders

In the Scenes folder you will see a scene titled: BasicTestScene
my work for homwork 2 is in this scene and you can press play in the unity editor to test out the demo. The player should move and shoot and 1 wave of enemies should spawn

You can also find my Bullet, Enemy, and Player prefabs in the Prefab folder
and my Autodestory, BulletForwardMovement, EnemyMovement, PlayerMovement, PlayerShooting, and WaveSpawner scripts in the scripts folder

these should be the primary assets that I used in the above scene.
