# How to test Game for HW 2 submission:
open the project in Unity
inside the assets folder you will see the Prefab, Scripts and Scenes folders<br>
<br>

In the Scenes folder you will see a scene titled: BasicTestScene <br>
my work for homwork 2 is in this scene and you can either press play in the unity editor above the scene view or click file then build and run to test out the demo. The player should move and shoot and 1 wave of enemies should spawn
<br>
You can also find my Bullet, Enemy, and Player prefabs in the Prefab folder
and my Autodestory, BulletForwardMovement, EnemyMovement, PlayerMovement, PlayerShooting, and WaveSpawner scripts in the scripts folder
<br>
These should be the primary assets that I used in the above scene.
